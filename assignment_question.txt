question: Note that you won't need to unload the existing kernel network driver
          to run this program. Give a short explaination of what this might 
          imply.


answer: This implys that the core functionality of the network driver is still
        functioning as we maniuplate the registers. Because of this, if we mess
        with any registers that effects the operation of the driver, poor
        results may occur. It also allows a user space program to supplement
        a kernel driver and offload some operations to userspace instead of
        kernel space.


I have seen James Ross's program function properly for this assignment:


            name:________________________    sig:_____________________
